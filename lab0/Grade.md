Hi Mohammad! 

Your documentation looks great and all your code compiles and produces the correct output.
Additionally, your pseudocode is pretty good. In the future I do encourage you to try to list 
as many steps as you can when writing your pseudocode. Pseudocode is meant to be sequential (step by step).
You can think of pseudocode as a universal language that you can easily translate to any prog. lang.
Since code is executed line by line, pseudocode should be written similarly.
It may seem redundant in some situations, but it definitely helps when it comes to understanding
the sequential process of your programs.

I also encourage you to think about you can go about creating a square without hard coding it.
Perhaps create a general method in which the user/programmer can modify the size of the square easily.

Again, great job on your first lab!
