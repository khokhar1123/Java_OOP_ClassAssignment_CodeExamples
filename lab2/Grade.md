Hi Mohammad!

Great job on your lab.
Also just a heads up, I encourage you to exception handle for basic things
either with conditional statements or by using try, throw, and catch.
If you're interested in learning about the try, throw, and catch keywords
I recommend looking them up in the official Java documentation.
It'll help ya out immensely in the future.

Your grades program accepted any number larger than 1
when prompting the user to enter -1 or 1
Using conditional statements to handle stuff like this
just makes your program cleaner and less 'buggy'

Again, great job on the lab!
