Hi Mohommad,
Great job on your lab!
One thing to consider is the fact that your FileWriting class allows the user to input things other than numbers. I encourage you to think of ways you can handle for this, ensuring the user only enters what is expected.
Additionally, your GradesReading program output could have been neater by truncating the decimals beyond the second decimal and rounding if needed.

Beyond this great job on your lab!
